        <p>Alright, so we're on this health kick. I mean, if it's gonna 
            stick, i should probably call it a "health lifestyle", but whatever.
            It's a kick right now.</p><p>So anyway, on this health kick, we're
            eating red potatoes. And, I'm telling you, red potatoes are delectable.
            I've always been an Idaho Russet man myself, but these red potatoes have
            me questioning my potato orientation.</p><p>So anyway, these puppies
            cook in an air fryer, which I don't understand at all but I'm totally
            into, kind of like women. Give these a shot. You're gonna love them.        </p>
            </p>
