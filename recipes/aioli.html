        <p>Look, I don't know what this word means. And I think this picture looks
        pretty unappetizing. But honestly, aioli is delish.</p>
        <p>I think aioli is pretty much just anything mixed with mayo. Sounds
        incredible. You can mix anything with mayo to make aioli, and you 
        can milk anything with nipples.</p><p>So anyway, I'm pretty sure 
         my wife is the one that figured out that anything mixed with mayo
         is aioli, so I'd like to give her credit. Or blame.
